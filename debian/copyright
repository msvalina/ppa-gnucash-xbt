 works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
 complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
 license designed for free software.
 .
 We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
 software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
 program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
 software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
 it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
 whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
 principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
 .
 .
 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
 .
 This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
 notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
 under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
 such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
 addressed as "you".
 .
 A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
 Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
 modifications and/or translated into another language.
 .
 A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
 the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
 publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
 (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
 within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
 textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
 mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
 connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
 commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
 them.
 .
 The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
 are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
 that says that the Document is released under this License.
 .
 The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
 as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
 the Document is released under this License.
 .
 A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
 represented in a format whose specification is available to the
 general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
 straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
 pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
 drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
 for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
 to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
 format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
 subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
 not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
 .
 Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
 ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
 or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
 HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
 PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
 by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
 processing tools are not generally available, and the
 machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
 purposes only.
 .
 The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
 plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
 this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
 formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
 the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
 preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
 .
 .
 2. VERBATIM COPYING
 .
 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
 commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
 copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
 to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
 conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
 technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
 copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
 compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
 number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 .
 You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
 you may publicly display copies.
 .
 .
 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
 .
 If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
 and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
 the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
 Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
 the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
 you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
 the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
 visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
 the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
 as verbatim copying in other respects.
 .
 If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
 legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
 reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
 pages.
 .
 If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
 more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
 copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
 a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
 Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
 general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
 charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
 option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
 distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
 Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
 until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
 copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
 the public.
 .
 It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
 Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
 them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
 .
 .
 4. MODIFICATIONS
 .
 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
 the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
 the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
 Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
 and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
 of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 .
 A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
    from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
    of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
    if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
 B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
    Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
    Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
 C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
    Modified Version, as the publisher.
 D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
 E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
    adjacent to the other copyright notices.
 F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
    terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
 G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
 H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
 I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
    publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
    there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
    given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
    Version as stated in the previous sentence.
 J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
    public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
    the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
    it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
    You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
    least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
    publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
 K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
    preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
    substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
    and/or dedications given therein.
 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
    unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
    or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
 M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
    may not be included in the Modified Version.
 N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
    or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
 .
 If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
 appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
 copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
 of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
 list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
 .
 You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
 nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
 parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
 been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
 standard.
 .
 You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
 passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
 of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
 Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
 through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
 includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
 by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
 you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
 permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
 .
 The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
 give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
 imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
 .
 .
 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
 License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
 versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
 Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
 list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
 license notice.
 .
 The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
 multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
 copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
 different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
 adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
 author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
 Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
 .
 In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
 in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
 "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
 and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
 entitled "Endorsements."
 .
 .
 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
 .
 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
 the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
 verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 .
 You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
 it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
 License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
 other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 .
 .
 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
 .
 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
 and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
 of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
 compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
 License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
 with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
 are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
 .
 If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
 copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
 of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
 covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
 Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
 .
 .
 8. TRANSLATION
 .
 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
 distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
 permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
 translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
 original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
 translation of this License provided that you also include the
 original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
 between the translation and the original English version of this
 License, the original English version will prevail.
 .
 .
 9. TERMINATION
 .
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
 as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
 copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
 automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
 parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 .
 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
 of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
 http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
 .
 Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
 License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
 following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
 of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
 Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
 as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
 .
 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
 .
 To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
 the License in the document and put the following copyright and
 license notices just after the title page:
 .
       Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
       Free Documentation License".
 .
 If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
 instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
 Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
 "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
 .
 If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
 recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
 free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
 to permit their use in free software.
